Biomedical Relation Extraction (BioRE)
BioRE is a deep learning pipeline for biomedical relation extraction using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project leverages a fine-tuned BERT-based model to extract meaningful relationships from biomedical text, facilitating insights in domains like medical research, drug discovery, and clinical data analysis.

Key Features
Fine-Tuned BERT Model: Utilizes the power of BERT for high-quality relation extraction.
Advanced Preprocessing: Efficiently processes large biomedical datasets with techniques like tokenization and cleaning.
Performance Metrics: Implements precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
Early Stopping and Checkpointing: Ensures optimal training and saves the best-performing model.
Datasets
PubTator Dataset:
Biomedical text annotated with entity mentions and relations.
Preprocessed for training and testing purposes.
Model Architecture
BERT-Based Relation Extractor:
Fine-tuned on labeled biomedical data.
Customized for domain-specific relation classification tasks.
