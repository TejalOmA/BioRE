# Biomedical Relation Extraction (BioRE)

**BioRE** is a deep learning pipeline for biomedical relation extraction using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project leverages a fine-tuned BERT-based model to extract meaningful relationships from biomedical text, facilitating insights in domains like medical research, drug discovery, and clinical data analysis.
